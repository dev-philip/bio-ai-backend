Recent advances in the activation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway and supplementation of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors have led to beneficial effects in skeletal muscle pathophysiology and function during aging and associated metabolic diseases. NAD<sup>+</sup> is also involved in the epigenetic regulation and post-translational modifications of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes to maintain tissue homeostasis. This review provides detailed insights into the roles of NAD<sup>+</sup> along with molecular mechanisms during aging and disease conditions, such as the impacts of age-related NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiencies on NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes, including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPs), CD38, and sirtuins within skeletal muscle, and the most recent studies on the potential of nutritional supplementation and distinct modes of exercise to replenish the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool.",

NAD<sup>+</sup> repletion ameliorates muscular dystrophy and improves the mitochondrial and muscle stem cell function and thereby increase lifespan in mice. Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> is considered as an anti-oxidant and anti-aging molecule. NAD<sup>+</sup> plays a central role in energy metabolism and the energy produced is used for movements, thermoregulation, and defense against foreign bodies. The dietary precursors of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis is targeted to improve NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis; however, studies have revealed conflicting results regarding skeletal muscle-specific effects. Recent advances in the activation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway and supplementation of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors have led to beneficial effects in skeletal muscle pathophysiology and function during aging and associated metabolic diseases.
